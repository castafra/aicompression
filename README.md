# A Deep Learning approach of video compression
This project tackles the issue of video compression with a Deep Learning approach. Moreprecisely, it focuses on the case of slideshows broadwast (which have become popular with thedevelopping of Internet, and even more popular this last year with the sanitary crisis). WithDeep Learning tools, we detect the different elements of a slide to process them differentlyin function of their type (text, image, background, charts ...) minimizing the quantity ofinformation to send.
